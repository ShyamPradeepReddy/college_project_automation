# Computer Vision Automation in Attendance and Library System


### üìö Abstract
This project aims to automate institutional tasks like student attendance and library book management using computer vision and artificial intelligence.  
The system includes a website with dashboards for students, faculty, and admin, integrated with:
- Face recognition for attendance.
- Generative AI-powered chatbot for student-library interaction.

Students can upload PDF books and ask questions, with the chatbot processing the content intelligently, reducing manual workload and bringing automation to the education system.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

#### Modules Involved:
- **Frontend (ReactJS):**
    - Dashboards for students, faculty, and admin.
    - Live camera access for face recognition.
    - Library search and chatbot interaction.

- **Backend (Django):**
    - APIs for attendance, user authentication, and face recognition.
    - AI integration using LangChain or Transformers for question answering from PDFs.

- **Face Recognition Module:**
    - OpenCV + Neural Network based encoding and recognition.
    - Real-time frame comparison with stored face encodings.

- **Chatbot with Generative AI:**
    - Parses PDFs ‚Üí Converts to QA context ‚Üí Handles student questions.

- **Database:**
    - PostgreSQL/MySQL for storing user data, attendance records, and book metadata.

#### Flow Diagram:

OpenCV + Neural Network based encoding and recognition.


Compares real-time frames with stored face encodings.


Chatbot with Generative AI:


Uses PDF parsers and NLP models (like GPT, BERT, or Haystack) to convert PDFs to QA context.


Enables students to ask natural language questions.


Database:


PostgreSQL/MySQL for storing user data, attendance records, and book metadata.

4. Software and Hardware Requirements
Software:
Frontend: React JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
![Chatbot](college_backend/IMG-20250422-WA0011(1).jpg)

Backend: Django (Python), Django REST Framework


Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, PyMuPDF, LangChain/Haystack, NLTK


Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL


IDE/Tools: VS Code, Anaconda, Postman
Hardware:
Webcam (Laptop/USB/Phone as webcam via DroidCam)

![Dashboard](college_backend/IMG-20250422-WA0012(1).jpg)

4 GB RAM minimum, 64-bit OS


Optional: GPU support for faster face recognition


5. Working Procedure
Registration & Login:


Admin registers faculty and students.


Users login via role-based dashboards.


Face Recognition Attendance:


Admin uploads student face images into the system.


Students face the camera; system marks attendance in real-time.


Faculty Dashboard:

![Register page of students](college_backend/IMG-20250422-WA0010(1).jpg)

View students under their department.


Modify attendance, mark absentees, filter by branch/date.


Library Dashboard & Chatbot:


Students browse books and register interest.


Faculty/admin approves requests.


Students can upload book PDFs and ask questions to the AI-powered chatbot.


Generative AI for PDF QA:


Uploads PDF ‚Üí Extracts text ‚Üí Embeds data ‚Üí Uses AI to answer student queries.


For example: ‚ÄúWhat is the definition of AI from this book?‚Äù ‚Üí AI replies contextually.

Additional AI Chatbot with PDF Feature
How It Works:
Students upload a PDF book to the library system.


The backend extracts content using PyMuPDF or pdfminer.


The content is split into chunks and embedded using a language model (BERT/GPT).


A question-answering model receives student queries and returns context-aware answers.
Tech Stack Used:
LangChain / Haystack for document-based QA.


Embedding models (Sentence Transformers).


Vector database (FAISS) for fast retrieval.


React chatbot UI with backend integration.
